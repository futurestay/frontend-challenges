## v1

### Description

Create a horizontal progress bar at the top of the window that emulates a long
or asynchronous request. There's no actual execution progress being tracked so
we'll estimate all requests to take a little over 15 seconds.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Styling

- the bar should be 6px tall and use a gradient that starts orange and ends red
- buttons should match the style below. On hover, button borders should increase
  to 2px width. On click, the border should increase to 3px.
- [visual example](./button.png)

#### Emulating the request

- add a green `Start Request` button to the canvas area that initiates the fake
  request. This button should change from `Start Request` to `Loading...` while
  the progress bar is active
- add a red `Finish Request` button to the canvas area that completes the fake
  request.

#### Animation

- the bar should animate progress from 0% to 90% over 15 seconds
- if the request doesn't finish within 15 seconds, the bar should hang at 90%
- the bar should animate to 100% (in 1 second) when the request finishes
  regardless of it's current position. It should then disappear 3 seconds later.
  Bonus: fade the bar away

## v2

### Description

In order to make the progress bar appear more realistic, we want to add
breakpoints to the bar that will slow the animation when hit.

### Acceptance Criteria

- update the progress bar to accept an array of "breakpoints" (**FYI not
  css/media breakpints**) that affect the animation of the progress bar.
  Progress should animate slower around breakpoints than between them. Each
  breakpoint will be provided as a number that represents a percentage
- the total progress time can be longer than 15 seconds (if it makes the
  exercise easier)
- allow the user to toggle between a progress bar with breakpoints and one
  without
